==============================

A podcast proxy written using kotlin dsl that sits between itunes search api, podcasts rss feeds and android apps allowing normalization of rss feeds to standard Json format that can be consumed by apps.

#Usage 

Search for any podcast using podcast client

```
val client=podcastClient<PodcastClient> {
readTimeout= Duration.ofSeconds(3000)
searchTerm="Guy Code" // can be any 
  }
// viola
client.podcasts  // an observable list of podcasts that match your search Term
 ```

Get it's feed url and feed it to the rssclient 
```
val client = rssClient<RssClient> { 
      rssFeedUrl="" // feed url of the clicked/selected podcast
      cacheDuration=20.minutes
   }
   client.jsonifiedRssFeeds() // jsonified rss feeds of the choosen podcast
   ```
And that its it! üòÅ
